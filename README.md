Hello, welcome to my README page, my name is Ese Odiase.

I am from Benin city, Edo state, Nigeria. I love to call myself Upscaling Developer, reason being that I enjoy learning and improving my development skills with every opportunity I get.

I am a self-motivated Front End Developer who began her HTML/CSS journey in the year 2017 while working a job as a Personal Assistant in Lagos, Nigeria.

Since March 2022 till date, I have been coding daily.

I am familiar with PHP fundamentals and MySQL but have chosen to stick with JavaScript and it Frameworks. I hope to become a full stack developer building projects with NestJS.

Area of Competence:

• React JS applications: API projects.

• HTML5, CSS3 and ECMAScript applications: these applications consists of single page only. While other pages built as components when navigated/visited get updated on the index.html just like React JS.

My portfolio is at:
